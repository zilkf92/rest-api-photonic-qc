rest-api-photonic-qc was the first Django app I built for our online quantum computing platform in the Christian-Doppler-Laboratory at the University of Vienna, starting on 28th Dec 2020. 

The code is based on the tutorial [Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Beginner](https://londonappdeveloper.com/product/build-a-backend-rest-api-with-python-django-beginner/) from London App Developer that I followed to build the first models, serializers, and views. 

In the end I used this repo as a sandbox for the proof of concept implementation of a REST API for web-based single qubit tomography with polarization encoded qubits. 

About 6 months and a few tutorials later I started the project all over again. You can find the current and maintained version here: [cdl-django-webservice](https://github.com/zilkf92/cdl-django-webservice/)
