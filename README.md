rest-api-photonic-qc was the first django app I built for our online quantum computing platform in the Christian-Doppler-Laboratory at the University of Vienna on 28 Dec 2020.

The code is based on the tutorial [ Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Beginner ](https://londonappdeveloper.com/product/build-a-backend-rest-api-with-python-django-beginner/) from London App Developer that I followed to build the first models, serializers, and views. 

In the end I used this repo as a sandbox for the proof of concept implementation of a REST API for web-based single qubit tomography with polarization encoded qubits.
